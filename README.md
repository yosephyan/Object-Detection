# Object-Detection

This project uses color segmentation to detect orange cones in images. It displays a bounding box, coordinates of the cone, and the cone's distance from the camera.

Instructions:
1. Open "test.ipynb" in Jupiter Notebooks
2. Can alternatively open "test.py" if preferred
3. Make sure that the name of the test images folder matches the name of the "folder" variable in the code.
4. Run code
5. Test images should display with bounding boxes and distances.
